# **POBOE: Quantifying a Defensive Player's Range and Ability to Break on the Ball**

## *By Trei Close, Tanner George, Leo Ott, and Matthew Solomon*

Defensive backs are at the center of every passing play. Teams rely on them to limit explosive gains, disrupt receivers at the catch point, and create turnovers against elite pass catchers who can separate quickly and adjust late. While coverage success is influenced by traits such as speed, explosiveness, instincts, and spatial awareness, there is currently no standardized metric that isolates a defender’s ability to break on the ball once it is thrown.

Our work introduces a new metric, **Play on Ball Over Expected (POBOE)**, designed to quantify this specific skill. POBOE answers a simple but fundamental question: *given where a defender is located at the moment the ball is thrown, how likely are they to be in position to make a meaningful play on the ball?*
